# Mixtape Machine Learning
### Experiments
These are some notebooks attempting to use tensorflow to generate note sequences. Definitely a work in progress!

If you have a GPU:
```
$ cd mixtape/ml
$ python3 -m venv mixtape
$ source mixtape/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -U pip
$ pip3 install notebook
$ jupyter notebook
```
